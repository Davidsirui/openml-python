==================
Obtaining Flow IDs
==================

This tutorial discusses different ways to obtain the ID of a flow in order to perform further
analysis.


.. code-block:: default


    # License: BSD 3-Clause

    import sklearn.tree

    import openml


    # Activating test server
    openml.config.start_using_configuration_for_example()


    clf = sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier()








1. Obtaining a flow given a classifier
======================================



.. code-block:: default


    flow = openml.extensions.get_extension_by_model(clf).model_to_flow(clf).publish()
    flow_id = flow.flow_id
    print(flow_id)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    420453




This piece of code is rather involved. First, it retrieves a
:class:`~openml.extensions.Extension` which is registered and can handle the given model,
in our case it is :class:`openml.extensions.sklearn.SklearnExtension`. Second, the extension
converts the classifier into an instance of :class:`openml.flow.OpenMLFlow`. Third and finally,
the publish method checks whether the current flow is already present on OpenML. If not,
it uploads the flow, otherwise, it updates the current instance with all information computed
by the server (which is obviously also done when uploading/publishing a flow).

To simplify the usage we have created a helper function which automates all these steps:


.. code-block:: default


    flow_id = openml.flows.get_flow_id(model=clf)
    print(flow_id)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    420453




2. Obtaining a flow given its name
==================================
The schema of a flow is given in XSD (`here
<https://github.com/openml/OpenML/blob/master/openml_OS/views/pages/api_new/v1/xsd/openml.implementation.upload.xsd>`_).  # noqa E501
Only two fields are required, a unique name, and an external version. While it should be pretty
obvious why we need a name, the need for the additional external version information might not
be immediately clear. However, this information is very important as it allows to have multiple
flows with the same name for different versions of a software. This might be necessary if an
algorithm or implementation introduces, renames or drop hyperparameters over time.


.. code-block:: default


    print(flow.name, flow.external_version)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    sklearn.tree._classes.DecisionTreeClassifier openml==0.11.1dev,sklearn==0.23.1




The name and external version are automatically added to a flow when constructing it from a
model. We can then use them to retrieve the flow id as follows:


.. code-block:: default


    flow_id = openml.flows.flow_exists(name=flow.name, external_version=flow.external_version)
    print(flow_id)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    420453




We can also retrieve all flows for a given name:


.. code-block:: default

    flow_ids = openml.flows.get_flow_id(name=flow.name)
    print(flow_ids)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    [41010, 73428, 89523, 153938, 166338, 187487, 231321, 232488, 249196, 332802, 335887, 358739, 406901, 407072, 415481, 420453, 420672, 424290]




This also works with the actual model (generalizing the first part of this example):


.. code-block:: default

    flow_ids = openml.flows.get_flow_id(model=clf, exact_version=False)
    print(flow_ids)

    # Deactivating test server
    openml.config.stop_using_configuration_for_example()




.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    [41010, 73428, 89523, 153938, 166338, 187487, 231321, 232488, 249196, 332802, 335887, 358739, 406901, 407072, 415481, 420453, 420672, 424290]
